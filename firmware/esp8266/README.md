# ESP8266

The firmware to publish to the MQTT Broker for the ESP8266 is in this folder.

Firstly, duplicate `config.sample.h` and rename the new file as `config.h`. Then open `config.h` and replace all the details in the code as specified.

Once you have updated `config.h`, you should be able to upload the code using the Arduino IDE.
